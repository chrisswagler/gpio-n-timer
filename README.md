# gpio-n-timer

This project was from a lab in Northeastern's Embedded Design: Enabling Robotics course. The purpose of this lab was to use the GPIO button and LED on the DE1-SoC board along with the clock. 

The final behavior of the program was simplistic: the LED would blink on/off every two seconds until the button was pressed, which would end the program. Though the functionality of the program was simple, it was useful in understanding the HPS side of the DE1-SoC with its GPIO pins. Additionally, the behavior of the clock was explored through timer loading, enabling, disabling, and with interrupt.
